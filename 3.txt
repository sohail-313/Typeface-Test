Design a datastore to save monitoring data of a service. Assume the service has 100 APIs and there are 1000 users who are roughly making 1 million requests per day. Some of the sample queries that will be performed on this datastore

- Get the API with maximum average response time across the users.
- Get the API with maximum average response time for each user.
- Get error percentage of each API in buckets of 1 hours for 24 hours.


API stands for Application Programming Interface
